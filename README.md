# CRISPro
An Automated Pipeline for Protein Conformation Stabilization by Proline

# Motivation
Recent studies have shown that the yield, antigenicity, and immunogenicity of an immunogen can be enhanced by stabilizing it into a specific conformation. Such stabilization often involves the engineering of proline mutations at residue positions where a proline is structurally compatible with the target conformation, but not with the alternative conformation. However, there is no pub-licly available tool that can design proline mutations for this purpose automatically. Here we im-plemented an automated tool, CRISP, that inputs structural coordinates of a desirable confor-mation and/or an alternative conformation, and outputs a list of residue positions where proline mutations are predicted to stabilize the target conformation based on compatibility of phi-psi an-gles, secondary structure, and steric clashes. Thus, CRISP can be used to engineer immuno-gens into specific conformation and to design serologic probes, capable of isolating antibodies that recognize a target shape.
